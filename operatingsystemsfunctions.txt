Operating systems, such as windows, serves as a base for the computer programs to work off of. They also serve as a function for file managers as a way to open programs or documents. They provide a way for data transfer as well. Each OS has it's own software so you can't run a a program that was made for windows on a mac OS and vice versa. However you can download programs that allow you to make virtual OS as long as your computer has the space to do so.

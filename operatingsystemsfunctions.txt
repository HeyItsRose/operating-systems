Operating systems, such as windows, serves as a base for the computer programs to work off of. They also serve as a function for file managers as a way to open programs or documents. They provide a way for data transfer as well. Each OS has it's own software so you can't run a a program that was made for windows on a mac OS and vice versa. However you can download programs that allow you to make virtual OS as long as your computer has the space to do so. The windows 10 OS gives you a start button to pull up computer navigation and has an area for optional apps to be laid out in a tablet form. You also have a search bar you can use for faster navigation, or if you don't know where something might be.

The OS acts as a plateform for all of the computers applications to work. The Mac OS also allows for connectivity with your apple phone if you have one. The Os monitors software needs and allows programs on the computer to run.
